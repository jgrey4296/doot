"""TASKS ARE THE MAIN ABSTRACTIONS MANAGED BY DOOT

  - JOBS create tasks
  - TASKS have actions
  - ACTIONS are individual atomic steps of a task, given the detailed information necessary to perform the step.

Jobs, as they can control refication order, can add setup and teardown tasks.
This can allow interleaving, or grouping.

  Communication:
  Job  -> Task   : by creation
  Task -> Action : by creation
  Action -> Task : by return value, updating task state dict
  Task -> Job    : by reference to the job

  Task -> Task     = Task -> Job -> Task
  Action -> Action = Action -> Task -> Action
